IMPORTANT: READ THIS FILE THOROUGHLY BEFORE USING IMP

- Purpose

IMP is a web-application which makes it easy for students who seeks theses, practica, 
and other study-related projects to get in touch with potential coworkers and suppliers of 
such projects. It supports both "want" and "have" advertisements of any parties, so it does 
not matter which party initiates the request.

The platform offers the option to search for advertisements using various filters. 
Apart from contacting the ad initiators directly, users can also just state their interest 
by "following" ads, similar to micro blogging services like Twitter.
